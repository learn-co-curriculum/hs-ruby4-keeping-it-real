##Real Things
We all know what stereotypes are, and whether we like it or not, we've all been stereotyped in some way or another.

The programmer stereo stands out in a big way. Nerdy, unsocial, really love math. This week, after working as a developer for two years, I took a few online career placement tests to see if I "have what it takes to be a professional programmer". According to those tests, I have "a few of the necessary qualities but not all of them". And then was told to probably look elsewhere. 

But let's be serious, that's ridiculous. So let's forget stereotypes. And accept that all walks of like can do all sorts of things.


Like [this model](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/20/tech/web/lyndsey-scott-model-coder/), with two apps in the apple app store. Cause that's badass.
